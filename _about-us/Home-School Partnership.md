Dear Parents,

We are committed and look forward to partnering you to support your child/ward’s wellbeing and learning.

In building our partnership with you, we are anchored on the following principles:

<a id="1"></a>

## Guiding Principles

- **Student-Centred Focus:** We prioritise our decision and engagement effort on the holistic development, well-being, and success of our students.
- **Shared Responsibility:** We will partner with parents in nurturing students to shape values, attitudes, and lifelong learning habits.
- **Respect and Trust:** Our communication is built on mutual respect and trust to ensure that we will do our best for our students.

We encourage open and respectful dialogue to support your child/ward’s well-being and learning.

By showing mutual courtesy and respect, we set a positive example for our children. The school will disengage from any communication that is rude, disrespectful, or abusive towards staff. **MOE values our staff** and will take firm action to protect them against unreasonable behavior, harassment, or abuse.

## Reaching out to our teachers

Parents are encouraged to contact our teachers during school hours: **7:30 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday to Friday, during term time.**

Teachers are not expected to respond to queries outside these hours, on weekends, and during school holidays.

As our teachers are likely to be in class during school hours, parents may wish to leave a message for the teachers.

In line with Civil Service standards, parents can expect responses within:

- 3 working days for simple queries
- 7 working days for queries requiring some investigation
- 21 working days for complex queries

For urgent messages during school hours, please contact the General Office at **6849 4400**.

## Arranging Face-to-Face Meetings

To schedule a meeting with a teacher, please email the teacher or contact the General Office at least **three days in advance** to minimise disruption to teaching duties.
