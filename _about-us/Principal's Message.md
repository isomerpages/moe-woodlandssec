It is with a great sense of gratitude that I join Woodlands Secondary School this year. Woodlands Secondary School has been a hope-building school for the community since 1982. I am honoured to join the school as the ninth Principal, and am committed to building on our strong foundation that have been laid by my predecessors. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs Tay Yang Fern, for bringing the school to new heights over the last 6 years in Woodlands Secondary School. 

At Woodlands Secondary School, we believe in growing our students to be confident individuals and our mission is to nurture enduring hearts and creative minds, so that they are ready to serve society. We are guided by our GR2EAT values of Growth, Respect, Resilience, Empathy, Appreciation, and Trustworthiness. Together with our mission, these values shape our educational approach.

In today's rapidly changing world, it has become even more important to equip our students with the right mindsets, skillsets and toolsets for the future. Here, we believe in cultivating the practice of lifelong learning, understanding that new skills and knowledge can often seem challenging before they become second nature. We embrace effort and view mistakes as integral parts of the learning process and encourage our students to believe in their own capacity for **growth** and **resilience**. We strive to instil in them a deep respect for themselves and a sense of personal accountability for their development.

We believe in helping our students flourish as an individual, living and working in a community. Here, we nurture our students' **respect** for themselves and others, foster their practice of **empathy** and **appreciation** for others, and guide them to be **trustworthy** individuals. We recognise that each student is unique, and everyone matters â€“Woodlanders are given a myriad of opportunities to explore diverse interests and grow in their potential.  

As we embark on this journey together, I look forward to working with all of you to continue building Woodlands Secondary School as a hope-building school of the community. 

Yours sincerely,<br>
Mrs Rebecca Yim<br>
Principal
