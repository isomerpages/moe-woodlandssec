Happy New Year!  A warm welcome to our Sec 1s, and welcome back to school to our Woodlanders.

At Woodlands Secondary School, we believe in growing our students to be confident individuals and our mission is to nurture enduring hearts and creative minds, so that they are ready to serve society. We are guided by our GR2EAT values of Growth, Respect, Resilience, Empathy, Appreciation, and Trustworthiness. Together with our mission, these values shape our educational approach.

In today's rapidly changing world, it has become even more important to equip our students with the right mindsets, skillsets and toolsets for the future. Here, we believe in cultivating the practice of lifelong learning, understanding that new skills and knowledge can often seem challenging before they become second nature. We embrace effort and view mistakes as integral parts of the learning process and encourage our students to believe in their own capacity for **growth** and **resilience**. We strive to instil in them a deep respect for themselves and a sense of personal accountability for their development.

We believe in helping our students flourish as an individual, living and working in a community. Here, we nurture our students' **respect** for themselves and others, foster their practice of **empathy** and **appreciation** for others, and guide them to be **trustworthy** individuals. We recognise that each student is unique, and everyone matters –Woodlanders are given a myriad of opportunities to explore diverse interests and grow in their potential.  

As we embark on this journey together, I look forward to working with all of you to continue building Woodlands Secondary School as a hope-building school of the community. 

Yours sincerely,<br>
Mrs Rebecca Yim<br>
Principal
