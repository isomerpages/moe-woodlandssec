### Alumni


The WDL Alumni Working Committee was officially formed on 10th May 2010 with 7 strong and committed former Woodlanders from the pioneer (80s), graduates of classes from the 90's and 2000's. Mr Thirumaran (HOD MT) and Mr Gary Ong (HOD PE/CCA) were appointed as the school contact persons to this committee.
