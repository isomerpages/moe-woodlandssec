Woodlanders stand tall and proud  
Honest in word, thought and deed  
Pursue truth, knowledge, excellence  
Persevere with dedication  
Oh strong at heart are we Woodlanders   
Loyal to school and country   
Making Wisdom and Truth our goal   
Our alma mater to cherish evermore   
Sharing in sincerity   
Forging bonds of friendship   
Come on one and all let’s strive and strive   
For the honour of our dearest school  
Oh strong at heart are we Woodlanders   
Loyal to school and country   
Making Wisdom and Truth our goal   
Our alma mater to cherish evermore


### School Crest

&gt; The overall blue tone 

* Reflects the setting of the school near the sea. 
* Blue represents harmony, serenity and a closeness to nature.

&gt; The six-pointed golden star 

Encompasses the total development of the individual's academic, physical, social, emotional, aesthetic and moral aspects that will be strengthened to a fineness represented by the points of the star.

&gt; The stylised W

* Designed as a soaring bird 
* Representing purity of spirit and ambition to reach greater heights. 
* Focus of loyalty and aims to foster a sense of belonging and pride in the school.


### Pupil Creed

I know there is something inside of me&nbsp;It’s what I call ability&nbsp;  
And I know I could do my best&nbsp;  
In everyday life’s a big big test&nbsp;  
And when the going gets tough&nbsp;  
And everything just seems so rough  
I know that I’m not alone  
  
**Chorus**&nbsp;  
I believe we can conquer dreams&nbsp;  
I believe we can reach for greater heights&nbsp;  
I believe we can do anything as one&nbsp;  
Woodlanders are the best when we unite  
  
I feel there is freedom in my heart&nbsp;  
I put pride in the freedom that I have&nbsp;  
With this freedom, I won’t lose respect&nbsp;  
That I feel for each and everyone&nbsp;  
Never stray from the ray of wisdom&nbsp;  
Achieve our goals through lifelong learning
