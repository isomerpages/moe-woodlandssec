### School Song

Woodlanders stand tall and proud  
Honest in word, thought and deed  
Pursue truth, knowledge, excellence  
Persevere with dedication  
Oh strong at heart are we Woodlanders   
Loyal to school and country   
Making Wisdom and Truth our goal   
Our alma mater to cherish evermore   
Sharing in sincerity   
Forging bonds of friendship   
Come on one and all letâ€™s strive and strive   
For the honour of our dearest school  
Oh strong at heart are we Woodlanders   
Loyal to school and country   
Making Wisdom and Truth our goal   
Our alma mater to cherish evermore

### School Crest

     style="width:35%">

The overall blue tone reflects the setting of the school near the sea. Blue represents harmony, serenity and a closeness to nature.

The six-pointed golden star encompasses the total development of the individual's academic, physical, social, emotional, aesthetic and moral aspects that will be strengthened to a fineness represented by the points of the star.

The stylised W is designed as a soaring bird representing purity of spirit and ambition to reach greater heights. It is the focus of loyalty and aims to foster a sense of belonging and pride in the school.
