### Our Journey

Woodlands Secondary School was established in 1982 with 205 students and a pioneer batch of 13 staff as a Government co-educational school to cater to the growing population in Woodlands and Marsiling area. It was initially sited in Si Ling Secondary School’s premises. In 1984, the school relocated to its current premises at 8 Admiralty Road, and was officially opened on 20th September. The school has a distinction of being the northernmost school in Singapore just a stone’s throw away from the Singapore-Johore Causeway.

Since its inception in 1982, Woodlands Secondary School has become a familiar icon in the neighbourhood. The first Principal of the school Mrs Narayanaswamy encouraged every student to develop to his or her ability. She believed in the age old adage ‘Mens sana in corpore sano’ (sound minds in sound bodies) and this has shaped the way the school has grown over time being student-centric in its approach and providing an all-round education for each and every Woodlander that passes through its doors. Over the years, the school has sustained the legacy of delivering value added outcomes for students, gathered the reputation of excellence in sports creating a niche for itself in football and sepak takraw, the uniform groups as well as the performing arts.

In 1999, Woodlands Secondary School became a single-session school and in 2003, the school underwent PRIME upgrading and was designated as an Innovation Centre for the cluster. Under the recommendation of the Principal Mrs Yap Ng Hwee Heng, the entrance of the school was shifted to face a less busy road and the address of the school changed to 11 Marsiling Road. In 2006, a new school vision of Weave, Dream, Lead was adopted as it progressed ahead to new peaks of excellence in educating each Woodlander that joins its ranks.

In 2012, the school celebrated its 30th anniversary and achieved the Singapore Quality Class (SQC) award. It also welcomed the addition of the Indoor Sports Hall as well as the synthetic turf field to the school facilities.  

Woodlands Secondary School was accorded Applied Learning Programme in Real Food, Real Science, and Learning for Life Programme in Active Global Citizens Programme in 2015.

In 2016, the school achieved the School Distinction Award (SDA) and four Best Practice awards in Teaching and Learning, Student All-Round Development, Character and Citizenship Education, and Staff Well-Being and Development. The school crafted a new vision, mission and set of values that was launched in 2018. The new vision ‘Every Woodlander a Gift to Society’ speaks of its aspiration of being a hope building school, a school that enables success for all.
