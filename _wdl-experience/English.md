#### Developing Gifts to Society

Every Woodlander is a discerning reader who clearly and empathetically communicates in the English Language.

#### Key Approaches

As Woodlanders come from different backgrounds with different levels of language skills, the following is designed to ensure all Woodlanders can develop necessary literacy skills for life:

##### INCORPORATING DISCOVERY, DIALOGUE AND DISCERNING PHASES IN OUR EL CURRICULUM, LEVERAGING ON TECHNOLOGY

*   Discovery phase: students are exposed to a wide range of themes with a variety of multi-modal texts. This allows students to delve deep into each theme, gathering a variety of viewpoints and perspectives. With the affordances of technology, students will be exposed to greater interactions with digital material that will broaden their horizons.
*   Dialogue phase: students are encouraged to be engaged in exploratory talk and discourse over physical and digital platforms with their classmates to listen to different and alternative perspectives, inquire further into the themes, and think critically to arrive at their own viewpoints.
*   Discerning phase: students will then be equipped with systematic thinking techniques to gain clarity in their thoughts, articulating these thoughts with precision, via written and verbal forms, with empathy and a sense of purpose.

##### DESIGNING A DIFFERENTIATED READING PROGRAMME
*   A culture of reading is essential to build basic literacy skills, which is the foundation for all learning.
*   Our reading programme provides. magazines that have captivating articles for various levels of readability and different interests. This is to ensure that all Woodlanders have access to appropriate  reading material, and eventually developing a habit of reading

##### EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION PROGRAMME

*   Sec 1 students will be acquiring skills on storytelling and social media presentation skills, which will facilitate their learning in the reading aloud component in the oral examination
*   Sec 2 and 3 students will be acquiring skills to generate quick and clear ideas on the spot, verbalising them in a structured manner, which will facilitate their learning in the spoken interaction component in the oral examination
