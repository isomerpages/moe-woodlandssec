## Food Science &amp; Technology
### Developing Gifts to Society
> Every Woodlander achieves the Triple D’s to be able to contribute to society.

* **D**iscovering the needs of others
* **D**aring to prototype and try to address these needs, then
* **D**reaming further and bigger to improve the prototype to serve those around us in the community

### Key Approaches

> Allowing students the space to explore, expand general knowledge and build interest

*   Providing varied hands-on learning activities which are process-focused,
*  Providing opportunities for first-person experiences such as Learning Journeys to industry partner and workshops at Science Centre,
*   Leveraging authentic and local day-to-day contexts which students can relate to, and
*   Employing the Design Thinking method in problem-solving.

### &nbsp;Key Programmes

> Exploring Food Science and Computational thinking first, deepening in one later. 

##### Tier 1 &amp; 2 - Broadening &amp; Deepening Learning <br>Growing all Woodlanders (Sec 1 &amp; 2)


**Food Sciences**
* Techniques in molecular gastronomy
* Drinks-Making competition - Woodlanders use Design Thinking to create a healthy and visually-appealing beverage with the molecular gastronomy techniques learnt.

**Computational Thinking**
* Basic and Advanced microcontroller programming. 
* Woodlanders then apply their skills to control and programme the flight paths of drones.


##### Tier 3 – Developing passion <br> Stretching those with strong interests  
Science Competition/Enrichment activities to stretch students’ potential. This includes: 
* Science and Technology Challenge by NYP
* Nexplorers (STEM Shell Challenge by STEM INC)
* Food Science Competitions (Nutri-booster- STEM INC &amp; RP, Swensen’s Ice-cream challenge-NYP, Picky Palette- STEM INC &amp; RP)
* Code for Fun programme
* STEM Stretch programme
