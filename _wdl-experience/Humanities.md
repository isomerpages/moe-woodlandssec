### Developing Gifts to Society

Every Woodlander a critical thinker with an inquiring mind ready to serve society.

### Key approaches

As Humanities subjects are new to secondary school students, the following is done to help Woodlanders grow in the subjects:

*   Developing Woodlanders’ thinking skills progressively, from Sec 1 to Sec 4.
*   Tapping on Woodlanders’ day-to-day experiences to build interests
*   Learning through investigation and discovery to develop interests and critical thinking
