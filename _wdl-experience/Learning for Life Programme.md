## Community Youth Leadership
### Developing Gifts to Society

Every Woodlander is a community youth leader ready to contribute to the betterment of the society.

### Key Approaches

> Every Woodlander has their own strengths. This can be tapped on to have significant impact upon themselves and others.

Guided by the Servant Leadership Philosophy (by Robert K Greenleaf, 1970), the LLP intends to develop the spirit of active citizenry through 3 tiers:
##### Tier 1 - For all Woodlanders
Engaging students in developing their awareness of the community and leadership knowledge, competencies or attitudes to serve the community

##### Tier 2 - For our Youth Envoys
Empowering students who show greater aptitude and/or interest to lead by actively engaging the community

##### Tier 3 - Stretching those with strong interest in community engagement (Youth Ambassadors)
Inspiring students to lead and mentor in VIA & Community Youth Leadership (CYL) experiences and to explore enduring engagement in the community.

### Â Key Programmes


> Growing all Woodlanders (Tier 1 Programmes)

Tier 1 programmes caters to all students across Sec 1 to 5 with the following themes:  
  
##### Secondary 1: Contributing to School Community  
Through applying principles of design thinking, students developed empathy and a sense of appreciation towards the unsung heroes in the school community and formulate ideas to improve the school through gardening.

##### Secondary 2: Serving the Immediate Community  
Students served the elderly through identifying their needs and collaborated with community partners like North West CDC and Sunlove Marsiling Senior Activity Centre where they get to come together and deliver an NDP Goodie Bag for the elderly.

##### Secondary 3: Redefining Boundaries  
Our students develop these competencies and values of empathy, care and responsibility towards others through training workshops and practise them through our Values-in-Action (VIA) platforms. At Sec 3, the Glocal Citizens Programme reaches its high point with an online cohort overseas experience with students from Cambodia, Thailand and New Zealand. Through this friendly online exchange, the school hopes to encourage our students to become future Community Youth Leaders by forging relationships with others and be active contributors to society.

##### Secondary 4 and 5: Seniors Giving Back - Mentoring and Advocacy  
Over the years of developing the understanding of their role as active citizens, the graduating students dedicate their time for the betterment of our Singapore future/society through advocacy projects of their choice focusing on Conservation and Sustainability.  
  
At Tier 1, students attend a workshop to acquire knowledge on servant leadership before engaging in community problem-solving through their Values-in-Action projects.

> Tier 2 Programmes
 
Tier 2 programmes provide training and leadership platforms for youth envoys to lead in the class VIA projects.

> Stretching those with strong interests - Tier 3 Programmes

* Dialogue with Prime Minister
