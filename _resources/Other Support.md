### Zonta Pari Programme

Zonta Club of Singapore is part of Zonta International, a worldwide service organization of women executives in business and the professions passionate about advancing the status of women in Singapore, around the region, and worldwide. It is made up of a fun loving group of women who enjoys working together to make contributions to the community.

The Project Pari was initiated in 2008.  It is a programme to help secondary school girls during their years of their secondary school education. Under this programme each student will receive a monthly pocket allowance to enable them to have proper meals and for transportation. Life skill programmes are conducted to help instil in the teenagers a sense of self-worth and to learn skills such as personal hygiene and financial management.

### Anti-Bullying Programme

An Anti-Bullying week is set aside yearly to educate students on the issue of bullying in its various forms. Lessons and an assembly programme will be organised to raise awareness and to provide opportunities for students to pledge their support for a bullying-free learning environment.
